# AI Organ Classifier

An AI model designed to classify medical images of the main organs: **heart**, **brain**, **liver**, and **limbs**. This project aims to assist in the automated analysis of medical images, making the process faster and more accurate.

## Features
- **Organ Classification**: Identifies and classifies the organ in the input medical image.
- **Supported Organs**: Heart, Brain, Liver, and Limbs.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on a robust dataset to ensure precision.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for predictions.

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data` folder.
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```
   - The trained model will be saved in the `models` folder.

2. **Predict Using Pre-Trained Model**:
   - Place your test image in the `test_images` folder.
   - Run the prediction script:
     ```bash
     python predict.py --image test_images/example.jpg
     ```
   - The result will display the predicted organ class.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a curated dataset of medical images. Each image is labeled with the organ it represents. 
---

## Development Environment
- **Code Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries Used**:
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)
